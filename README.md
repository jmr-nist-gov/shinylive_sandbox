# `shinylive` Sandbox

This repository is nothing more than a sandbox to play with [`shinylive`](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/) which allows shiny apps to run completely client-side using [`webr`](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) where shiny apps run as static pages using [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
